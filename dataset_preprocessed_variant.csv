Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Alamy This article is more than 2 years old Mass deaths of elephant seals recorded as bird flu sweeps across the Antarctic This article is more than 2 years old Researchers warn of one of ‘largest ecological disasters of modern times’ if the highly contagious disease reaches penguin colonies Bird flu is spreading in the Antarctic, with hundreds of elephant seals found dead, and fears it could bring “one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times” if the highly contagious virus reaches the remote penguin populations. The virus was first reported among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Since then, researchers and observers have reported mass deaths of elephant seals, as well as increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls and brown skua at several other sites. Cases have been confirmed 900 miles (1,500km) west of South Georgia, among southern fulmar on the Falkland Islands. Dr Meagan Dewar, chair of the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, told the Guardian that the situation among southern elephant seals was concerning. “At some sites we’ve had mass mortalities, where we are getting into the hundreds,” she said. “There is a likely chance it could be avian influenza.” So far tests have confirmed bird flu deaths at eight sites across the Antarctic, and the disease is suspected with confirmation from tests still pending at 20 further sites where animals have died.

Photograph: imageBroker/Alamy Researchers reported that a number of elephant seals had been exhibiting symptoms of avian flu, such as difficulty breathing, coughing and accumulations of mucus around the nose. Lethargy, spasms and an inability to fly are symptoms in birds. While a number of seabird cases have been confirmed, many – including the elephant seals – are still classed as suspected, pending lab results. So far there are no recorded cases on the Antarctic mainland – home to unique ecosystems that are some of the world’s most isolated – but the disease is expected to arrive in the coming months as birds move. Dewar said: “It’s devastating to watch that happen and recording all the cases we’re getting.” Penguins are starting to cluster together as the breeding season starts, and this close contact makes them particularly vulnerable. Previous outbreaks in South Africa, Chile and Argentina show they are susceptible to the disease. “If the virus does start to cause mass mortality events across penguin colonies, it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times,” researchers wrote in a pre-print research paper last month. ‘Catastrophic’: bird flu reaches Antarctic for the first time Read more Many species in the Antarctic are found nowhere else, so the consequences for the region of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) spreading are unknown. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research said recently: “Given the dense breeding colonies of wildlife in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions, HPAI is expected to have devastating impacts on the wildlife and to lead to catastrophic breeding failure and mortality events in the region.” The virus has killed an estimated 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru. Dewar said: “If we start to get outbreaks similar to what we’ve seen in South America that could have very big impacts. Emperor penguins and chinstrap penguins have been taking significant declines, so if we get large outbreaks in those species, that could cause further pressure on those colonies.” The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 – which started in 2021 – is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. The strain spreading in Antarctica is clade 2.3.4.4b, which has decimated bird populations across the UK, continental Europe, South Africa and the Americas, with seabird colonies experiencing losses of 50% to 60%. The H5N1 strain has not yet reached Oceania View image in fullscreen Adélie penguins during nesting season on the Antarctica’s Danger Islands. Photograph: Michael Polito/AFP/Getty Dr Michelle Wille, from the Centre for Pathogen Genomics and the University of Melbourne, who is helping to record deaths, said: “It’s terrible news that it’s now in the sub-Antarctic, and we are very worried about viral spread into the Antarctic. In addition to negative affects on animals, the ‘removal’ of vast numbers of animals from the Antarctic ecosystem may have long-term ecosystem effects.” Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey and the British government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency are identifying possible cases, testing them and sharing data. It is challenging to record what is happening because of the size of Antarctica and the small number of people monitoring it. A number of reports of mass deaths have come through tour vessels. 10,000 naps a day: how chinstrap penguins survive on microsleeps Read more Many places in South Georgia are now closed to tourists and even researchers have to go through a number of procedures to get there in a bid to stop the disease spreading, said Dr Michael Wenger, who trained as a marine biologist and has been working as a guide in Antarctica for 18 years. He added: “It’s already hard to estimate numbers in normal situations, because the area is huge and there are a lot of animals.

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Animal and Plant Health Agency Published 18 July 2024 The UK’s Chief Veterinary Officer has urged farmers to remain vigilant for bluetongue virus. There has been a recent increase in confirmed BTV-3 cases in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium with some animals showing severe clinical signs. Farmers are reminded that free testing is now available for animals moving from the highest risk counties to live elsewhere in Great Britain or to be sold at a market within a high-risk county where there will be buyers from outside the high-risk counties. This will help guard against animal movements potentially transporting undetected disease to new areas. The high-risk counties are Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent and East Sussex. Last November, APHA and The Pirbright Institute identified the first case of the disease in Great Britain through the annual bluetongue surveillance programme. Bluetongue virus is primarily transmitted by midge bites and affects cattle, goats, sheep and camelids such as llamas. The impacts on susceptible animals can vary greatly – some show no clinical signs or effects at all while for others it can cause productivity issues such as reduced milk yield, while in the most severe cases can be fatal for infected animals. Bluetongue does not affect human health or food safety. The virus can also be spread through germplasm (semen, ova, and embryos) as well as transmitted from mother to unborn offspring. Current situation There are currently no live cases of bluetongue virus and no evidence that there is circulating bluetongue virus in England. However, given the increase in temperature, there is now an increased risk and bluetongue transmission is possible. Biting midge activity increases with the warmer weather, and there remains a very high probability of a new introduction of bluetongue virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) into livestock in Great Britain in 2024 through infected biting midges being blown over from northern Europe, where a number of cases have now been detected. Farms close to the coast in counties along the east coast of England from Norfolk to Kent and along the south coast from Kent to Devon are at highest risk of incursion. Biting midges are most active between April and November and the timing of a potential incursion will depend on the temperature and wind patterns. There is an active surveillance programme running, which involves the trapping of midges across the country and working with partners such as the Met Office to monitor the likely spread of the virus based on temperature and wind patterns. Farmers should continue to monitor their animals frequently for clinical signs and make sure their animals and land are registered with APHA so we can locate animals in the event of an outbreak. Surveillance of susceptible animals and epidemiological assessments will continue. We will keep the situation under review. Find out more information on the latest situation and guidance . Control of the disease The Bluetongue Serotype 3 Disease Control Framework was developed in discussion with the farming industry. It sets out how disease control efforts will focus on movement control of susceptible animals and their germinal products (semen, eggs, ova and embryos) as a precautionary tool to stem spread of the disease until a safe and effective vaccine for bluetongue virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) becomes widely available. Work is underway with vaccine manufacturers to facilitate safe access to a BTV-3 vaccine as soon as possible, but it is vital that any vaccine has the confidence of industry, consumers and trading partners. This includes understanding the efficacy of any vaccine deployed across all species, together with potential impacts on trade. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: “Bluetongue does not pose a threat to human health or food safety, but the disease can impact livestock farms, and cause productivity issues. “Although there are currently no live cases of bluetongue virus in Great Britain, we know that the likelihood of the virus entering is increasing and so I would urge farmers to remain vigilant and report any suspicions to the Animal and Plant Health Agency. “If you intend to move animals to live out of high-risk counties please take advantage of this free testing as it will help stop the movement of undetected disease.” Animal and Plant Health Agency interim Chief Executive Jenny Stewart said: “The recent increase in cases in Europe underlines how important it is for farmers and animal keepers to continue monitoring their livestock and to take up the offer of free testing where necessary. “The Animal and Plant Health Agency’s risk assessment confirmed there is a very high chance of bluetongue virus entering Great Britain this year, and our world-leading scientists, vets and field teams stand ready to tackle an outbreak of bluetongue virus and ensure farmers are kept up to date and supported.” Strict rules on the movement of livestock from regions affected by bluetongue are already in place and farmers are reminded that animals imported from these regions must be accompanied by the relevant paperwork to clearly show they meet certain conditions designed to reduce disease risk, such as correct vaccination. Following confirmation of BTV in a non-imported animal in England, some trading partners may restrict exports of bluetongue susceptible animals or their products. The latest information on availability of individual export health certificates can be found on Gov.uk . NI and GB ruminants cannot be exported from an GB Assembly Centre to the European Union or moved to Northern Ireland until further notice. BTV is a notifiable disease. Suspicion of BTV in animals in England must be reported to the Animal and Plant Health Agency on 03000 200 301 More information about bluetongue is available here.

                                    07:03:08 PKT (Web Desk) - An Australian toddler has died after catching an illness rife in pigeons. Medics still don't know how the two-year-old, who was battling leukaemia, caught the highly contagious virus. But they think she might have got infected by touching pigeon faeces or fluids. The girl, who wasn't identified, is only the fifth human victim of Newcastle disease since records began in 1926. Caused by avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1), the illness causes a raft of deadly neurological symptoms including twisted necks or trembling wings in birds. But it is uncommon among humans and typically only leads to conjunctivitis. The toddler was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, New South Wales, after suffering cold-like symptoms, nausea and vomiting for three weeks. She had completed her second cycle of chemo just six weeks earlier. Medics said she had not recently travelled or come into contact with pets or sick family members. Over the following four days, her condition deteriorated as she suffered a series of epileptic seizures. MRI scan results did not raise anything of concern, while repeat test results for the cause of the virus also returned negative. She was given antiviral drugs, antibiotics and anti-seizure medications to help treat brain swelling and reduce discomfort. She died almost a month after being admitted after treatment failed to stop further brain tissue death.

Canadian Food Inspection Agency data show there have been 39 B.C. outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu since Oct. 20, resulting in almost five million birds dying of infection or being ""humanely depopulated"" to halt the spread of the virus. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck By The Canadian Press Posted December 10, 2023 4:28 pm. Last Updated December 10, 2023 4:29 pm. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says it has detected the presence of Avian influenza at a commercial poultry farm in Abbotsford. It is now the 51st B.C. location where the contagious viral infection has been detected at commercial or backyard bird operations since October.

Avian flu leading to local turkey shortage in B.C. 8 skunks found dead in Metro Vancouver had avian flu: government Commonly known as bird flu, avian influenza can affect several species of food-producing birds as well as pet birds and wild birds. The CFIA’s national tally says more than five-and-a-half million birds have been culled in B.C. since the first case in the province in April 2022. No birds can be transported within a restricted zone so all of them must be put down to prevent the virus from spreading, the agency says. Amanda Brittain, chief information officer with the BC Poultry Association, has previously said the industry is on level “red” — the highest of three levels — in its biosecurity program as farmers fight to fend off the outbreaks, which have been triggered by migrating wild birds.

La grippe aviaire s'attaque aussi aux animaux marins. Au Brésil, près de 1.000 phoques et otaries en sont morts, rapporte l'agence Reuters ce lundi 11 décembre. Précisément, 942 individus ont été victimes de l'influenza aviaire dans l'État de Rio Grande do Sul. Un précédent bilan, fin octobre, faisait état de 500 individus retrouvés morts . Les carcasses des animaux doivent être enterrées ou incinérées pour éviter la contamination, tandis que les spécimens malades doivent être euthanasiés, selon l'océanographe brésilien Silvina Botta, cité par Reuters. 148 foyers dans le pays La contagion chez les mammifères marins semble avoir commencé au Pérou , puis avoir fait le tour du continent sud-américain, touchant la faune sauvage au Chili, en Argentine, en Uruguay et maintenant au Brésil. Le ministère brésilien de l'agriculture a signalé 148 foyers de grippe aviaire dans le pays, principalement le long de la côte, déclarant une urgence sanitaire pour contenir la maladie, qui, selon lui, ""n'est pas encore considérée comme endémique au Brésil"". Le Brésil maintient donc son statut de pays ""indemne de la maladie"", car ""aucune production commerciale (de volailles, NDLR) n'a été affectée"" jusqu'à présent, selon le gouvernement. En France, le niveau de risque lié à la grippe aviaire sur le territoire métropolitain français a été relevé le 5 décembre de ""modéré"" à ""élevé"" après la détection de ""plusieurs foyers"".

(WIBW) - Avian Influenza has been identified in McPherson and Rice counties. The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), has identified highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in two egg layer facilities - one in McPherson County and one in Rice County. This marks five cases of HPAI in Kansas this fall. Since the start of the outbreak in 2022, there have been 21 cases of HPAI in Kansas. KDA officials said they are working closely with USDA–APHIS on a joint incident response at the affected premises in the two affected counties. According to KDA’s animal health officials, the facilities both increased their biosecurity upon the initial HPAI outbreak in 2022 and have been continuously monitoring their flock. Upon noticing clinical signs of HPAI in their birds, they immediately contacted KDA. The affected premises were placed under quarantine and the birds will be humanely depopulated and disposed of in an approved manner to prevent the spread of the disease. KDA officials said in addition, they will be establishing a 20-km surveillance zone around the infected premises, and other farms or properties with poultry that fall within that zone will not be allowed to move birds or poultry products on or off their property without permission from KDA. The animal health team is working to locate all poultry owners in the area to ensure they know the symptoms of HPAI and are taking critical steps to protect their birds. If you own poultry and live in McPherson or Rice counties, please contact KDA at 833-765-2006 or KDA.HPAI@ks.gov . You can also self-report your birds HERE . KDA officials indicated this outbreak of HPAI is primarily spread by migrating wild waterfowl, so a critical part of protecting your flock is to establish separation between your domestic birds and wild birds as they migrate through your region. Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Find guidance on biosecurity on the KDA Division of Animal Health webpage at agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza . KDA officials said highly pathogenic avian influenza is a contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds. Poultry owners should attentively monitor your birds for symptoms of HPAI which include: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also cause sudden death in birds even if they aren’t showing other symptoms. KDA officials noted if these symptoms are observed in your birds, immediately contact your veterinarian. If you don’t have a regular veterinarian, contact KDA’s Division of Animal Health office toll-free at 833-765-2006. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , KDA officials said the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern or a food safety concern. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F is recommended as a general food safety precaution. KDA officials noted for more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states and more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to KDA’s avian influenza webpage at agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza or call KDA at 833-765-2006.

The infected cattle lose their appetite and cannot stand on their legs. Puss comes out of the wounds and the cattle dies after some days. Mrunal Manmay Dash 14 Dec 2023 08:19 IST Calf Infected With Lumpy Skin Disease A deadly disease has spread among the cattle in Cuttack’s Nischintakoili block killing many cows and calves in the last few months. Advertisment The symptoms of the disease include wounds on their bodies including faces and legs. The infected cattle lose their appetite and cannot stand on their legs. Puss comes out of the wounds and the cattle dies after some days. As per reports, many cattle have died of the disease in the area and they continue to die. While the villagers alleged the doctors have failed to identify the disease so they do not know its treatment, the veterinarians term it as ‘Lumpy Skin Disease’. Advertisment “There is an unknown disease attacking our cows and calves. Forget about treatment, the doctors can’t even diagnose it. The medicines that they are prescribing have failed. Three cows have already died. There are two more infected cows in my cowshed that may die soon,” said Debendra Sahu, a local cow herder. Another cow herder, Kavita Rath said, “One calf in my cowshed has developed lumps on its skin. Those lumps are growing in size and accumulating puss in them. The calf is not eating anything and lost a lot of weight. The doctors have come several times and injected it with medicines but in vain.” Asked about the disease, veterinary doctor Sudipta Sahu said, “This disease is called ‘lumpy skin’. This is a viral disease. This time around, the virus is attacking the calves between the age of seven days to six months.” “We have vaccines for lumpy skin disease and the immunisation process is going on regularly. However, as per the vaccine protocol, we cannot inoculate calves below six months,” Sahu said. Unfortunately, lumpy cow skin disease has no direct antiviral treatment. Instead, the infected animals receive supportive care, which involves the use of antibiotics, painkillers, and wound care sprays to treat symptoms.

(KAIT) - Biologists report finding geese infected with avian flu in several Northeast Arkansas counties, including Craighead. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said Wednesday that biologists conducting aerial surveys of waterfowl populations found small groups of dead snow geese and Ross’s geese in Arkansas, Craighead, and Lonoke counties. The geese were collected and tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, AGFC said. Additional suspected cases have been found in Clay, Poinsett, Faulkner, Prairie, and Pulaski counties. Biologists report finding geese infected with avian flu in several Northeast Arkansas counties, including Craighead. (Arkansas Game and Fish Commission) “While sightings are not as prevalent as last year’s outbreak, the continued presence of the disease on the landscape does create a need to update hunters and anyone who has domestic birds or poultry livestock,” AGFC stated. While the risk of infection is low among humans, hunters can help minimize the risk by following the following guidelines: Harvest only waterfowl that act and look healthy. Do not handle or eat sick animals. Wear disposable gloves when handling and cleaning game and field dress outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water afterward. Dispose of unwanted parts in a manner that prevents scavenging by domestic animals and wildlife. Thoroughly cook all game to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit before eating it. Do not feed pets or domestic animals uncooked portions of waterfowl. For more information, click here . Copyright 2023 KAIT. All rights reserved.

Biologists conducting aerial surveys to generate waterfowl population estimates last week located a few small groups of dead snow geese and Ross’s geese across the state. In Craighead and Lonoke counties several were collected and tested positive for influenza. Additional suspected cases have been found in Prairie, Pulaski, Faulkner, Clay and Poinsett counties. “While sightings are not as prevalent as last year’s outbreak, the continued presence of the disease on the landscape does create a need to update hunters and anyone who has domestic birds or poultry livestock,” the agency reported. The risk of humans contracting the disease remains low, but hunters can help further minimize that risk by following a few simple precautions. As a general precaution, hunters should use good hygiene practices when handling, cleaning and preparing harvested waterfowl. The more concerning risk associated with HPAI is its potential for spillover to domestic poultry. Commercial poultry producers may want to implement biosecurity measures as advised by the Arkansas Agriculture Department. Many Arkansans in rural areas have small flocks of domestic ducks and chickens as pets and a source for fresh free-range eggs may want to take extra precautions as well. Domestic birds should be completely isolated from wild birds or their parts. After handling waterfowl, hunters should change or clean clothing, shoes and other equipment before coming into contact with poultry, including commercial production facilities and backyard flocks.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said that “active surveillance” in the north-east Kent temporary control zone (TCZ) had identified the three further cases. All three are from the same herd where five positives for BTV were identified on December 15. In a statement Defra and APHA said: “All three animals will be humanely culled to minimise the risk of onward transmission. “The TCZ is not being extended and movement restrictions continue to apply to cattle, sheep and other ruminants in the zone."" Bluetongue This brings the total number of cases identified in the UK todate to 22 on eight different holdings. ""There is currently still no evidence that bluetongue virus is circulating in Great Britain. “Surveillance is ongoing,” Defra and APHA added. A single case of BTV was first identified in a cow in Kent last month. Previously to this confirmation, the last outbreak in England, Scotland or Wales had been in 2007. A TCZ with a radius of 10km was established around the first case in Kent which was then extended to a larger zone. Source: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs A number of different types of bluetongue are currently circulating in Europe including: BTV-3; BTV-4; BTV-8. BTV type 3 was confirmed in cattle and sheep in north-east Kent. At the beginning of this month, routine surveillance also identified two cases of bluetongue in cattle on a farm near Cantley, Broadland, Norfolk. A 10km TCZ was also established around the premises, and both animals were humanely culled to minimise the risk of transmission. The virus is transmitted by midge bites. It affects cows, goats, sheep and camelids such as llamas. Farmers have been advised that vaccination is available for some types of bluetongue. According to Defra, adult cattle may serve as a source of BTV for several weeks, “while displaying little or no clinical signs of disease, and are often the preferred host for insect vectors”.

The cattle were illegally moved from an area where there is suspected foot and mouth disease, and the aim is to maintain those provinces that have potential to resume exports completely free of foot and mouth. Vet department director, Dr Jairus Machakwa said Shingirai Kwadikupi of Rushinga smuggled 10 cattle from Mozambique’s Changara District under Tete Province. “The cattle were moved from Mozambique without veterinary import or movement permits and without police clearance,” he said. “The cattle were moved illegally from an area suspected of foot and mouth disease. By so doing, Mr Kwadikupi contravened the provisions of Animal Health (Movement of Cattle and Pigs) Regulations, 1984.” The veterinary department said moving cattle without permits was causing or could cause outbreaks of animal diseases, impoverishing smallholder farmers who should be deriving livelihoods from the sale of their livestock. When the destruction and disposal of animals is being done after illegal activity, the law dictates that it must be witnessed by police, while owners of the cattle will not receive any compensation. Illegal animal movements are the major drivers of transmission of animal diseases from one area to the next, with the most dreaded being foot and mouth and January Disease. Experts say if farmers and traders comply with animal movement regulations, Zimbabwe will be able to maintain a stable animal health situation where there are no outbreaks of foot and mouth. The veterinary department works closely with the police to ensure all cattle moving to farms and markets have the necessary veterinary permits, and are tick-free, as is required by the law. Foot and mouth is the most contagious disease known to cattle, and is caused by a virus. It is an internationally listed or notifiable disease and it affects the economies of countries depending on cattle and pig industries. Symptoms of foot and mouth include excessive salivation, limping, presence of sores in the mouth and in between the toes. Countries experiencing outbreaks of foot and mouth suffer from trade embargoes, limiting exports of even non-livestock products from affected areas. While the disease is not particularly lethal in tropical countries, it can kill most infected cattle in cooler and wetter climates, hence the measures taken by potential export markets to prevent transmission from imported meat. Stakeholders in the livestock industry are advised to comply with veterinary restrictions if the cattle economy is to revive successfully.

(FOX5) - The Nevada Department of Agriculture (NDA) has received reports of a confirmed case of Equine Herpes Virus – Type 1 (EHV-1) in a horse at an event in Clark County. According to a media release, the infected horse has been placed under quarantine. Per Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 571.160, the exact locations of the detection cannot be disclosed. EHV-1 is a respiratory, neurologic disease. EHV-1 is a reportable disease, meaning when veterinarians diagnose it, they are required to notify the NDA, per Nevada Revised Statute NRS 571.160. “If you recently attended an event in Clark County, monitor your horses for signs of illness including fever, decreased coordination, urine dribbling, limb weakness, lethargy or inability to stand,” said NDA Director Goicoechea, DVM. “Contact your local veterinarian immediately if you notice symptoms.” Director Goicoechea recommends biosecurity practices as event season is underway, and suggests always monitoring horses for signs of disease, like fever or runny nose. Biosecurity means implementing practices to reduce the chances of an infectious disease being transferred by people, animals, equipment or vehicles. EHV-1 and other diseases can be easily transferred on boots, coats, gloves and equipment. Some basic practices include: Never share equipment between horses, and always wear clean clothes when going from ill horses to others. Always start chores at healthy horses, and end with sick or recovering (within 30 days) horses. Avoid common areas such as hitching rails, wash racks, etc. during an outbreak. Copyright 2023 KVVU.

أخبار الجنوب الرياضة No Result View All Result غلق أسواق الماشية بولاية تبسة تزامنا مع تسجيل بؤر مؤكدة مخبريا للحمى القلاعية في عدة ولايات by عبد الكريم عزوڨ 17 ديسمبر، 2023 in أخبار الشرق , المحلي Reading Time: 1 mins read أصدر نهاية الأسبوع الفارط والي ولاية تبسة “سعيد خليل”، قرارا يقضي بغلق أسواق الماشية المنتشرة عبر كافة إقليم الولاية مؤقتا لمنع ظهور داء الحُمَّى القلاعية، عقب تسجيل بؤر مؤكدة مخبريا ببعض ولايات الوطن، ويأتي هذا تزامنا مع إحصاء 364 حالة إصابة بداء الحمى المالطية خلال سنة 2023. فيروز رحال ارتفاع محسوس في حالات الإصابة بالحمى المالطية سجلت مؤخرا المفتشية الولائية البيطرية بتبسة، ارتفاعا محسوسا في عدد الإصابات البشرية بداء الحمى المالطية بعدد إصابات قدرت بـ 364 حالة إصابة بحوالي 17 بلدية، وهذا حسب تقرير صادر عن مديرية المصالح الفلاحية بتبسة، والذي تحوز “أخبار الوطن” نسخة منه، حيث كشف أن التحقيقات الوبائية التي قامت بها ذات المصالح خلال الـ 05 سنوات الأخيرة، أكدت أن الإصابة بالحمى المالطية لم يعد مقتصرا على المجترات الصغيرة (الماعز) بل تعدت إلى الأبقار، وهو ما أدى إلى اقتراح وضع استراتيجية جديدة للحد من انتشاره، ومن بين الإجراءات تم وضع استراتيجية جديدة تهدف إلى تلقيح كل الحيوانات الحساسة. المشاكل التي تُعرقل مكافحة الحمى المالطية كشف ذات المصدر، أن تنقل المواشي بصفة مستمرة وعدم تعريف القطعان، من بين الأسباب التي تعرقل عملية مكافحة داء الحمى المالطية، ويُضاف إلى ذلك تأخر استلام الاعتمادات المالية من طرف الوزارة الوصية، والخاصة بتعويض المربيين الذين ذُبِحت حيواناتهم، ناهيك أن عدم احترام المربيين للإجراءات الوقائية يبقى عاملا أساسيا في تفشي هذا المرض، من خلال التهاون في مراقبة الحيوانات الجديدة داخل المُنشأة وإخضاعها للتحاليل من طرف مصالح المفتشية البيطرية، مع عدم تطبيق كل شروط النظافة على مستوى أماكن تربية حيواناتهم، كما أن رفض هؤلاء لإخضاع الحيوانات للذبح الصحي والتخلص منها عن طريق بيعها هو الآخر يعرقل مهمة محاربة هذا الداء. وفي تصريح مدير المصالح الفلاحية لولاية تبسة “مختار مرزوق”، كشف وجود عناصر أخرى ساعدت على تفشي وباء الحمى المالطية، وهي عدم الانخراط في البرامج الوطنية لمكافحة هذا المرض وعدم المشاركة في عمليات جمع الحليب لدى ملبنات الولاية (ملبنة المراعي + بالشريعة) و(ميلك بتبسة)، حيث لا يزال المربون يواصلون عزوفهم عن دفع الحليب المجمع للملبنتين، كما أكد أن انتشار نقاط بيع غير مرخصة للحليب الطازج غير المبستر مجهول المصدر ومجمع بطرق عشوائية، يساعد على تفشي الظاهرة، ومن بين البلديات التي سجلت ارتفاعا في عدد الإصابات البشرية، هي بئر العاتر وبئر الذهب وبلدية الشريعة. انتشار الحمى القلاعية في عدة ولايات يؤدي إلى غلق أسواق الماشية كشف القرار الولائي رقم 2514 الصادر بتاريخ 14 ديسمبر 2023 عن والي ولاية تبسة، سعيد خليل، والمتضمن الغلق المؤقت لأسواق بيع المواشي ومنع تجمع الحيوانات لتفادي ظهور الحمى القلاعية، أن وزارة الفلاحة والتنمية الريفية سجلت العديد من البؤر المؤكدة مخبريا للحمى القلاعية ببعض ولايات الوطن، وبؤرا أخرى بالبلد المجاور (تونس)، وهو الأمر الذي دفع بمدير المصالح الفلاحية إلى اقتراح الغلق المؤقت لأسواق بيع المواشي بإقليم الولاية تفاديا لظهور هذا المرض بالولاية، وهو القرار الذي وافق عليه الوالي وأصدره تحت الرقم سابق الذكر، لفترة مؤقتة قدرت بـ 30 يوما قابلة للتجديد حسب تطورات الحالة الوبائية بالولاية، مع استغلال الفرصة لاستكمال الإحصاء التكميلي للثروة الحيوانية. وكشفت المادة الثانية من هذا القرار الولائي، أن كل تنقل للحيوانات (الأبقار، الماعز والأغنام) داخل وخارج تراب الوطن، يجب أن يخضع للرقابة البيطرية مع تحرير شهادة صحية بيطرية تثبت سلامتها من هذا الداء، محررة من طرف المصالح البيطرية الرسمية. تواصل عملية إحصاء الثروة الحيوانية انطلقت نهاية الشهر الفارط المصالح الفلاحية لولاية تبسة، في عملية إحصاء الثروة الحيوانية للموسم الفلاحي 2023/2024، بهدف تحديد الأرقام الحقيقة لوضع خارطة صحية للتحكم في الأمراض التي تهدد الثروة الحيوانية، وقد كشف “قديري محمد الطيب” المكلف بالإعلام بمديرية المصالح الفلاحية بتبسة، عن تسخير كافة الموارد المادية والبشرية اللازمة لإنجاح عملية إحصاء الثروة الحيوانية، التي تم الشروع فيها عبر بلديات الولاية، بعد إطلاق وزارة الفلاحة والتنمية الريفية وبالتنسيق مع وزارة الداخلية والجماعات المحلية، عملية إحصاء شاملة للثروة الحيوانية منذ العام الماضي، وقد اتخذت نفس الإجراءات هذه السنة وستشمل كل الأصناف على غرار الأغنام والأبقار، رؤوس الماعز والخيول وحتى الإبل، حيث تم تنصيب لجان محلية لمتابعة العملية والتي تقوم بها فرق ميدانية مكلفة بالإحصاء، تدون الحصيلة دوريا عبر المنصة الرقمية المخصصة لذلك . وتندرج هذه العملية أساسا في إطار تمكين أجهزة الدولة من وضع استراتيجية مبنية على معلومات دقيقة وحقيقية لتحقيق الأمن الغذائي، خاصة فيما تعلق بالمواد الأساسية، مع وضع خارطة صحية تجعل التحكم في مختلف الأمراض المنتشرة عملية سهلة وبسيطة، مشيرا بذلك إلى أن عملية الإحصاء تسير في ظروف حسنة، ما يمكنها من الانتهاء في الآجال المحددة وطنيا، داعيا بذلك الفلاحين إلى ضرورة التعاون مع مختلف أعوان الإحصاء لتسهيل مهامهم. ارتفاع حالات الإصابة بداء الكلب تُسجل دوريا ولاية تبسة كغيرها من الولايات، بؤرا عديدة لمختلف الأمراض الحيوانية، على غرار داء الجدري والحمى المالطية وطاعون المجترات الصغيرة واللّسان الأزرق. وفي ذات السياق تُواصل المصالح الفلاحية مكافحة هذه الأمراض في وقتها المحدد، حيث كشف أيضا مدير ذات المصالح، أنه بالرغم من جميع المجهودات المبذولة، إلا أنه يتم سنويا تسجيل حالات نهش حيواني للأطفال، خاصة في المناطق الريفية، أي أكد أنه من الواجب تكثيف عمليات إبادة الحيوانات الضالة والمُتشردة، وحسب التقرير الذي تحوز “أخبار الوطن” نسخة منه، فقد تم تسجيل ارتفاع في حالات الإصابة بداء الكلب خلال سنة 2023، وهذا مقارنة بالسنوات الفارطة، أين سجلت هذه السنة حوالي 52 حالة إصابة، فيما تم تسجيل 38 حالة في 2022 و35 حالة في 2021 و13 حالة في 2020، وقد تم مؤخرا تلقيح حوالي ألف حيوان في إطار الحد من هذا الداء. مواضيع ذات صلة أخبار الشرق برج بوعريريج: توقيف 3  متورطين في

Share to facebook Twitter Linkedin pinterest mail All five animals will be humanely culled to minimise the risk of onward transmission. The TCZ is not being extended and movement restrictions continue to apply to cattle, sheep and other ruminants in the zone. The first case of the emerging BTV-3 strain was confirmed in Kent in November and there have now been a total of 19 cases on eight different holdings. There is currently still no evidence that bluetongue virus is circulating in Great Britain and surveillance is ongoing, the Ruminant Health & Welfare group said. Cattle do not often show clear signs of disease so owners should also look out for signs of fatigue and lower productivity including reduced milk yield. However, signs may include: Crusty erosions around the nostrils and muzzle Redness of the mouth, eyes, nose Redding of the skin above the hoof Nasal discharge Reddening and erosions on the teats. Signs in sheep include: Lethargy, reluctance to move Crusty erosions around the nostrils and on the muzzle Discharge of mucus and drooling from mouth and nose Swelling of the muzzle, face and above the hoof Reddening of the skin above the hoof Redness of the mouth, eyes, nose Breathing problems Erosions on the teats. Suspicion of BTV in animals in England must be reported to the Animal and Plant Health Agency on 03000 200 301. In Wales, contact 0300 303 8268.
